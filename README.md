## Architecture
- In this project, we worked with Express HTML, JavaScript, and the SPA framework Angular.
  Express is a Node.js library used primarily to create webservers that would then host a website or another web application.
  Express handles the data being pushed from the server to the client, this includes HTML requests, JSON loading onto a page,
  and more. Javascript is a popular coding language in web development that can create versatile websites that dynamically
  loads content, and adds animations to web pages. Angular was an interesting framework to get to know. Compared to the aforementioned
  development tools, Angular has a component based system that requires a user to create components for any particular features
  or services that are wanted in the program. Overall, Angular is probably my least favorite, and I would likely not use it for
  anything professionally, as the idea of there only being one page that handles anything would harm your SEO in the long term.
- A NoSQL database was used because it is a widely used option to create a long term database system that does not require any
  knowledge of SQL or its structure. I have worked with SQL for many years, so it was interesting to learn something new.

## Functionality
- JSON is a lightweight data format that is widely used to transport data from the backend to a client's system.
  It allows you to assign a "list" of data, that contains key and value pairs. This makes for easy organization
  when sending data. While Javascript is a coding language, JSON is simply a data type used to store and transport
  data.
- In the Angular section, we created code that lists trips. The list of trips each has a button that allows us to update trips
  on the same page. This advantage of this is that we don't need to create a whole new page for this system to work, as it
  renders the trip editing on the existing page. Benefits of reusing UI components includes faster rendering, and a smaller
  amount of data needing to be sent back and forth from the server to the client when any changes are made.

## Testing
- Methods in this instance are used to tell the backend what the code is going to use. Ie the GET method is used to retrieve data,
  while the POST method is used when sending data to the server. Endpoints are points in the code that allows your code to securely
  access the backend. Without endpoints, there wouldn't be many secure ways to transport data. Security is important in a full stack
  application, because oftentimes a full stack application handles sensitive data.

## Reflection
- This course has helped me learn about the complex parts of web development. I have learned how to develop a full stack applciation using
  Express, HTML, Javascript, MongoDB, and Angular. Before this course I had never worked with Angular and the experience has been invaluable.
